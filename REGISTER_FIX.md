# Register Component Fix

## Issues Fixed

The register component had several issues that prevented it from properly saving input data on the rising edge of the clock and enable signals:

### 1. **Incorrect Port Configuration**
- **Problem**: Register was using generic `OUT` port instead of proper `Q` output port
- **Fix**: Updated `getComponentOutputPorts()` in `port-positions.ts` to return `['Q']` for register components

### 2. **Flawed Evaluation Logic**  
- **Problem**: Register output logic wasn't properly handling the `Q` port - it was just returning `props.state` for any output
- **Fix**: Updated `computeOutput()` in `engine.ts` to specifically handle `Q` port for register components

### 3. **Signal Mapping Issues**
- **Problem**: The signal evaluation system wasn't properly mapping register outputs to `Q` port signals
- **Fix**: Updated all signal evaluation sections to handle `comp.id + ':Q'` for register components instead of generic `OUT`

### 4. **Visual Representation Problems**
- **Problem**: Register component was showing generic `OUT` port in UI instead of proper `Q` output
- **Fix**: Updated `GateView.tsx` to render `Q` output port specifically for register components

## How the Register Now Works

1. **Input Ports**: `D` (data), `EN` (enable), `CLK` (clock)
2. **Output Port**: `Q` (stored data output)
3. **Logic**: On rising edge of clock (`CLK`), if enable (`EN`) is high, the register captures the data input (`D`) and stores it internally
4. **Output**: The `Q` port continuously outputs the currently stored state

## Testing Instructions

To test the register functionality:

1. **Setup Circuit**:
   - Add a REGISTER component to your workspace
   - Add a TOGGLE for data input (connect to `D` port)
   - Add a CLOCK for clock signal (connect to `CLK` port) 
   - Add a TOGGLE for enable signal (connect to `EN` port)
   - Add an LED to show output (connect to `Q` port)

2. **Test Scenario**:
   - Set data input (`D`) to HIGH using the toggle
   - Set enable (`EN`) to HIGH using the toggle
   - Observe the clock signal oscillating
   - **Expected**: On each rising edge of clock, the LED should reflect the current state of the data input
   - **Previous Issue**: The register wasn't capturing/storing the input data properly

3. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Try changing data input while enable is LOW - register should not update
   - Try changing data input while clock is LOW - register should not update until next rising edge
   - Verify register "remembers" the last captured data value

The register should now properly implement D-flip-flop behavior with enable control.
